# Configure Reading Settings

In case you followed **Demo Contents Import**, The reading settings should already be configured and you do not need to follow this section.

I am assuming that you have imported the XML successfully and you have home page and news page available for use. If this is not the case then simply create a new page using Home Template and name it as Home after that create another page using default template and name it as News.

To configure reading settings you need to visit **Dashboard → Settings → Reading** and choose that front page displays as static page. Then select **Home** as **Front Page** and **News** as **Posts Page**. As, displayed in screen shot below.
