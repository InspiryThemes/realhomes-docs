# Setup Favorites Page

## How Favorite Properties Feature Works!

A visitor can add properties to his favorites collection, So that he can visit his/her favorites properties later on.

Visitor do not need to login to use this feature as if he/she is not logged in then the favorite properties information is stored in cookies. 

But if the user is logged in then this information is stored in database as user meta. 

The user can delete the Property from favorites collection by clicking on trash icon.
