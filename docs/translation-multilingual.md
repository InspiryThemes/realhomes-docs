# **Translate RealHomes into Multiple Languages**

If you are planning to translate your website into multiple languages, then [WPML Multilingual Plugin](https://wpml.org) is the best option. To initiate its setup you can start reading from the [WPML Setup](https://realhomes.io/documentation/wpml-basic-setup/) section in the documentation.

### **Required WPML Package**

You must get **Multilingual CMS Package** of WPML Translation plugin, because the Multilingual Blog doesn't contain **String Translation Plugin of WPML**, and it is quite essential to translate the strings of the theme and your website.
