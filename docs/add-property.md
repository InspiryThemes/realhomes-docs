> From website admin point of view, An author is basically a site user/member that login into site and add a property using admin side ( If his role is author or above ) OR add a property from front end property submission page ( if his role is subscriber ). An agent is a custom post type and any user with role equal or above author role can add those agents into database and later on assign properties to those agents. So, basically it is a flexible feature that can be used in a way that match your needs.

1. None will hide the agent's information box.
2. Author profile information will display the Author( user who added the property ) information. You can configure your user information from edit profile page ( Please check related documentation section for details of setting up front end profile edit page ).
