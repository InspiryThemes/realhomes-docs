# Elementor Pro

## Elementor Pro Compatibility with RealHomes Theme

RealHomes Theme works well with the FREE version of Elementor Page Builder, so the pro version is not required to use RealHomes Theme.

Elementor Pro is not included in RealHomes Theme and must be bought separately. Elementor Pro and RealHomes Theme are fully compatible with each other.

We don't recommend or suggest our clients to buy it if they only want to use Real Estate features on their website.

## Custom Header & Footer

If you already have Elementor Pro or you are going to buy it, then you can use the Custom Header and Footer feature of Elementor Pro. RealHomes Theme is 100% compatible with the custom header and footer features of Elementor Pro.
