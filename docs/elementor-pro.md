## Elementor Pro Compatibility with Real Homes Theme

Elementor Pro is the paid version of Elementor and Real Homes Theme is fully compatible with Elementor Pro. You can find more details about it [here](https://www.elemntor.pro).

## Elementor Pro is not REQUIRED

Real Homes Theme works well with the FREE version of Elementor Page Builder so the pro version is not required to use Real Homes Theme. Elementor Pro is not included in Real Homes Theme and must be bought separately.

We don't recommend or suggest our clients to buy it if they only wants to use Real Estate features on their website.

## Custom Header & Footer

If you already have Elementor Pro or you are going to buy then you can use Custom Header and Footer feature of Elementor Pro. Real Homes Theme is 100% compatible with the custom header and footer feature of Elementor Pro.
