# Elementor Pro

## Elementor Pro Compatibility with RealHomes Theme

RealHomes Theme works well with the FREE version of Elementor Page Builder, so the pro version is not required to use RealHomes Theme.

Elementor Pro is not included in RealHomes Theme and must be bought separately. Elementor Pro and RealHomes Theme are fully compatible with each other.

We don't recommend or suggest our clients to buy it if they only want to use Real Estate features on their website.

## Custom Header & Footer

**Elementor Pro is not required to create Custom Header and Footer in RealHomes**.

You can create your own Custom Header or Footer using Elementor (free version) with RealHomes. Check out <strong><a href="https://realhomes.io/documentation/custom-header-footer-elementor/">this section of the documentation</a></strong> to learn how.
