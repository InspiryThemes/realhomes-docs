# Create Home Page

In case of Demo Contents Import the home page is already created and you do not need to follow this section.

To set up the Home page you need to create a new page, Go to **Dashboard → Pages → Add New**. You can give this page a title "**Home**" yet you do not need to include any contents for now. Select the “**Home Template**” template from the Page Attributes section, as displayed in screen shot below and click “**Publish**”.
