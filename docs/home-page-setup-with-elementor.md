# Create Home Page with Elementor

Since version 3.8.0, we have integrated Elementor into Real Homes Theme so our customers can add content conveniently using Elementor Page Builder. We have added **14 widgets of Real Homes Theme in Elementor** which means you will find 14 custom widgets of the theme in Elementor's panel.

## Create Home Page

To set up the Home page you need to create a new page. In order to do so go to **Dashboard → Pages → Add New**. You can give this page a title "**Home**" yet you do not need to include any contents for now.

Select the “**Home**” template from the **Page Attributes** section, as displayed in screen shot below and click “**Publish**”.
