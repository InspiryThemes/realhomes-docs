The **User Roles** feature allows seamless synchronization between user profiles and their respective Agent or Agency profiles, providing a range of roles including Agent, Agency, Owner, Developer, Buyer, and Seller.

To enable this feature, go to **Dashboard → Easy Real Estate → Settings → Users → User Role Management**.

Once enabled, the system will automatically create a new Agent or Agency profile for each newly registered user, depending on their selected role. Any profile updates by the user will be synchronized with the associated Agent or Agency details.

**Enable User Synchronization:** Easily toggle user synchronization with Agent/Agency profiles to streamline profile updates.

**Avatar Fallback:** If user profile images are not available, avatars can automatically fall back to Agent/Agency profile images for a unified visual experience.

**Control Auto-Assignment:** Allows admins to prevent auto-assignment of users to Agent roles if the synchronization feature is disabled.

**Enable/Disable Specific Roles:** Choose which roles (e.g., Agent, Agency, Owner, Buyer, Developer, Seller) to enable or disable within your system.

This ensures that profile information remains consistent across all roles, making property and agency management more efficient.
