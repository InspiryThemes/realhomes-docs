### User, Agent, Agency Synchronization

It can be enabled in **Easy Real Estate** settings [ **Dashboard → Easy Real Estate → Settings → Users → User Role Management** ] section.

Once it is enabled, the system will automatically create the new Agent / Agency for newly registered user. The related Agent / Agency information will also be updated when the user updates his / her information in the profile.
