# User Roles Management

!!! info "Important"

    Ensure **User Registration** is set up and activated for this feature to function properly.

### **User, Agent, Agency Synchronization**

The **User Roles** feature allows seamless synchronization between user profiles and their respective Agent or Agency profiles, providing a range of roles including Agent, Agency, Owner, Developer, Buyer, and Seller.

To enable this feature, go to **Dashboard → Easy Real Estate → Settings → Users → User Role Management**.

Once enabled, the system will automatically create a new Agent or Agency profile for each newly registered user, depending on their selected role. Any profile updates by the user will be synchronized with the associated Agent or Agency details.

**Available options:**
- Control auto-assignment of users to Agent roles if synchronization is disabled.
- Set user avatars to fallback to Agent/Agency profiles if needed.

This ensures that profile information remains consistent across all roles, making property and agency management more efficient.
