# Selection Of Design (Classic or Modern) 

We strongly suggest selecting and finalize a design at the start and use that to run the website smoothly in the long term. It is possible that a specific feature may not be available/supported in other design variations due to design limitations.

One of these designs (**Classic** or **Modern**) can be selected by navigating to **Dashboard → Real Homes → Design**.
