# Selection Of Design (Classic or Modern or Ultra)

!!! info "Important"

    If you are planning to [**import a demo**](https://realhomes.io/documentation/import-demo/), you can skip the design selection step as the demo import process will automatically configure the relevant design for you.  

It's highly suggested to choose and finalize a design from the outset to ensure a smooth experience in the long-term. Certain features may not be available or supported in alternative design variations due to inherent design limitations.

One of these designs (**Classic**, **Modern** OR **Ultra**) can be selected by navigating to:  
**Dashboard → RealHomes → Design**
