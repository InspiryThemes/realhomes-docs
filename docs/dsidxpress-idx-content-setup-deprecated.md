# dsIDXpress IDX Content Setup 

### **Creating Slider**

**dsIDXpress IDX plugin** is quite limited in terms of customizability and options to create elements such as dynamic slider so we will use the option **Slider Based on Slides Custom Post Type**.

Follow the steps written below to set it up.

1. Navigate to **Dashboard → Pages** and edit the page assigned as Home Page (shown in the following screenshot).
