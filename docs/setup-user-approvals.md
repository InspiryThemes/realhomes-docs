# User Approvals Management

We've added the user approval management feature in RealHomes, empowering you to efficiently oversee user registrations. With this functionality, you gain the ability to review and either approve or deny any user who signs up on your platform. 

This ensures that you maintain control over who gains access to your website, enhancing security and customization options.
