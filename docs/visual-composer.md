# Visual Composer

### **Elementor Page Builder Support**

We have added several widgets of RealHomes theme in Elementor Page Builder, and there are several more in our pipeline, so we decided to remove the support of WP Bakery Visual Composer plugin entirely, and we don't intend to provide it further.

### **Migrate to Elementor**

We highly suggest you to use Elementor Page Builder with RealHomes theme and if you are still using Visual Composer then you should start migrating your content from Visual Composer to Elementor Page Builder. Activating both page builders at once may cause issues.

### **Helpful Information**

For more information about RealHomes' Elementor Widgets/Features, you can check out the following links.
