After making changes, click the **Save Changes** button to apply the updates.

ðŸ“Œ **Important:**  
Once you've enabled or disabled any post type, it's highly recommended to **re-save your permalinks** to ensure proper URL behavior.  

You can do this by navigating to **Dashboard â†’ Settings â†’ Permalinks** and clicking the **Save Changes** button without making any modifications.
