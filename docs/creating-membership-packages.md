If you are creating a recurring membership package through Stripe then paste the ID of that package in the **Stripe Subscription Plan ID** text field.

> **Note**: The price of a membership package cannot be changed after creating the package. If you want to change the price of the package then please create another one.

Select Pending Review, then click OK and then Update button to update the status of membership.
