# Misc Customizer Settings  

### **Label for Featured Properties**  
With the continuous expansion of RealHomes Elementor widgets, we have completely discontinued support for the WPBakery Visual Composer plugin. Moving forward, we will no longer provide compatibility or updates for it.  

### **Label for Property Detail Page Link Text**  
We strongly recommend using **Elementor Page Builder** with the RealHomes theme. If you are still using WPBakery Visual Composer, consider migrating your content to Elementor for better performance and compatibility. Running both page builders simultaneously may cause conflicts.  

### **Custom Placeholder Image**
