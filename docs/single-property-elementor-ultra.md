Version 4.1.0 of RealHomes introduced Elementor-based Single Property support in the Ultra design. You can either import a pre-designed layout or design your own.

### ✅ Import & Setup Pre-Designed Single Property Layout

1. Navigate to **Dashboard → RealHomes → Customize Settings → Property Detail Page → Basics**.
2. Enable the **Elementor Single Property Template** option.
3. In the **Sample Property ID for Elementor Editor** field, enter the **Post ID** of a published property that you’d like to use as a preview within the Elementor editor.  
   You can find the Property ID in the WordPress Dashboard under **Properties → All Properties** (hover over a property title to see the ID).

📌 *Note: Some RealHomes widgets are dynamic and may not render inside the Elementor editor. To see a full preview, save your changes and view the property on the frontend.*

📥 Download the <a href="https://realhomes.io/documentation/ultra-assets.zip">Ultra Assets</a> zip package for import files.
