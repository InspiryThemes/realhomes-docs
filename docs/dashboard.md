# Dashboard

Introducing Members (User/Agent) Dashboard template in version 3.12 to manage(add,edit,remove) properties, favorites, profile information and membership subscriptions. 

This new dashboard will be common for both variations and is a replacement for existing templates ( Submit Property, My Properties, Edit Profile, Favorites and Memberships ).
So these existing templates are deprecated as all future functionality will be introduced within this new Members Dashboard.
