# iHomefinder Optima Express Plugin  

### ⚠️ Important Note Before You Proceed

!!! warning "A Better, Modern, and More Scalable Option Is Available"
    While Optima Express works, we **strongly recommend using MLS On The Fly™** instead.  
    It is the **officially supported** MLS integration for RealHomes, offering:

    - Support for **200+ MLS providers**
    - **Native RealHomes compatibility**
    - Faster & more reliable syncing  
    - No outdated shortcodes or legacy widgets  
    - A modern API-based workflow

Optima Express remains available for those who *already use iHomefinder* or prefer their IDX ecosystem, but MLS On The Fly™ is the **recommended solution for new RealHomes users**.
