# Setup Registration

## Allow Registration

To allow user registration, you need to check the **Anyone can register** option from **Dashboard → Settings → General** page and *Save Changes* as displayed in the following screenshot. Otherwise only Login form will be available for the users.

## Restrict Backend Access

You must restrict backend access of the user level which you have setup in the previous setup. So navigate to **Dashboard → Real Homes → Customize Settings → Users & Members → Basic** and select **Contributor** (or the user role you have selected) for the first option (shown in the following screenshot).
