# Mortgage Calculator Setup

!!! note
    If you have Imported Demo Contents the Mortgage Calculator is already active and you do not need to follow this section.

From RealHomes v3.11.1, the **Mortgage Calculator is now a part of the theme** and you don't have to install it as a separate plugin.

The new **Mortgage Calculator section/widget will only display for the Properties available for Rent**. The Rent status is determined from the Customizer settings shown in the following screenshot.
