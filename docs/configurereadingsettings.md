# Configure Reading Settings

In case you have **Imported Demo Contents**, The reading settings should already be configured and you do not need to follow this section.

I am assuming that you have imported the **Demo Contents** successfully and you have home page and news page available to use. If this is not the case then simply create a new page using **Home Template** and name it as **Home** after that create another page using default template and name it as **News**.

To configure reading settings you need to visit **Dashboard → Settings → Reading** and choose that front page displays as static page. Then select **Home** as **Front Page** and **News** as **Posts Page**. As, displayed in screen shot below.
