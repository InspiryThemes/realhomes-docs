# Create and Configure News Page

## Create News Page

In case you have Imported Demo Contents the news page is already created and you do not need to follow this section.

To set up the News page you need to create a new page, Go to **Dashboard → Pages → Add New**. You can give this page a title "**News**" yet you do not need to include any contents for now. Select the “**Default Template**” template from the **Page Attributes** section, as displayed in screen shot below and click “**Publish**”.

## Configure Reading Settings

I am assuming that you have already created Home page.

To configure reading settings you need to visit **Dashboard → Settings → Reading** and choose that front page displays as static page. Then select **Home** as **FrontPage** and **News** as **Posts Page**. As, displayed in screen shot below.
