# Sections Manager for Home Page

If you want to change the order of the sections of home page then you can use **Sections Manager**.

**Sections Manager** gives you control over the sections order of home page, for example, you can display the blog posts section as first instead of featured properties section or you can put Features section at the top or in the middle.

Navigate to **Dashboard → Appearance → Customize → Home Page → Sections Manager**. To change the order of the sections you can just drag and drop.
