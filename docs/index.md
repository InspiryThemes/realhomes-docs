## Tips to Improve Website Performance

* Opt for a VPS over shared hosting and ensure it's SSD-based for better resources.
* Upgrade to **PHP 7.4 or newer**, a requirement for WordPress, and ensure MySQL version is **5.6 or higher** (Contact your hosting provider for updates).
* Use a reliable cache plugin like **[WP Fastest Cache Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-fastest-cache/)** and thoroughly test your site after installation and configuration.
* Enhance user experience with plugins like **[Flying Pages](https://wordpress.org/plugins/flying-pages/)** for faster loading.
* Reduce image load times with an image compression plugin such as **[Imagify](https://wordpress.org/plugins/imagify/)**.
* Boost performance by leveraging a CDN service to deliver content faster and more efficiently.

## RealHomes Specific Cache Configurations

* Avoid combining JavaScript files for the RealHomes theme when using a cache plugin (or any optimization plugin). This theme isn't typical and certain scripts load only when needed. Additionally, dynamic data is generated before some scripts based on various settings. Combining JavaScript files can lead to errors.
* RealHomes utilizes the following cookies (if related settings/plugins are enabled). Configure your cache plugin to exclude pages that use these cookies, or request the same from your host if it's like WPEngine (which doesn't permit cache plugins and manages caching at the server level):

## Using a Child Theme

Utilizing a child theme is strongly recommended to ensure smooth updates of the parent theme whenever new versions are released. The main theme pack downloaded "**rh-main-package.zip**" from [ThemeForest](https://themeforest.net/downloads) includes a pre-built, ready-to-use child theme, often referred to as "**realhomes-child.zip**".

## Updating the Theme

RealHomes offers auto-updates within the WordPress dashboard. However, if you're updating from a very old version, you can refer to [this knowledge base article](https://support.inspirythemes.com/knowledgebase/how-to-update-realhomes-theme-to-the-latest-version/).
