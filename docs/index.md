## Tips for Performance Improvement
* It is recommended that you should use a VPS instead of shared hosting as it gives you better resources to work on. Also make sure your hosting is based on SSD drives.
* Use **PHP 7.4 or greater** as it is faster than previous versions of PHP and a <strong><a href="https://wordpress.org/about/requirements/" target="_blank">base requirement of WordPress</a></strong> with **MySQL version 5.6** or greater. ( You can communicate with your hosting provider to get it updated. )
* Use a good cache plugin like <strong><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-fastest-cache/" target="_blank">WP Fastest Cache Plugin</a></strong> and test your site properly after installing and configuring it. 
* You can also consider installing plugin like  <strong><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/flying-pages/" target="_blank">Flying Pages plugin</a></strong> for faster user experience.
* Consider using a image compression plugin like <strong><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/imagify/" target="_blank">Imagify</a></strong>.
* We also recommend using a CDN plugin like **BunnyCDN** (using their WordPress Plugin which is <strong><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/bunnycdn/" target="_blank">BunnyCDN â€“ WordPress CDN Plugin</a></strong> as we have tested it and it turn out to be one of the easy to use plugins for CDN.


### RealHomes Specific Cache Configurations

* Do not unify (combine) JavaScript files for RealHomes theme while using a cache plugin ( or any optimisation plugin ) as it is not an average blog theme and certain scripts are only loaded when required. Also, dynamic data is generated before few scripts based on various settings. So, Combining JavaScript files can create errors.
* RealHomes uses following cookies (if related setting/plugin is enabled). So, You can configure your cache plugin to not cache pages that uses these cookies OR you can request the same from your host if your host is like WPEngine ( who do not allow cache plugin and handles the cache on server level ).

## About Child Theme
    
It is highly recommended to use the child theme so that you can easily update parent theme whenever a new update is available. A pre-built ready to use child theme is included in the main theme pack which you have downloaded from [ThemeForest](https://themeforest.net/downloads). It is commonly called **rh-main-package.zip**.
