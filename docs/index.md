### **Important Note**
    
It is highly recommended to use the child theme so that you can easily update parent theme whenever a new update is available. A pre-built ready to use child theme is included in the main theme pack which you have downloaded from [ThemeForest](https://themeforest.net/downloads). It is commonly called **rh-main-package.zip**.

## Few Performance Improvement Tips

### **Basic Recommendations**

* Use **PHP 7.3 or greater** as it is faster than previous versions of PHP and a [base requirement of WordPress](https://wordpress.org/about/requirements/) with **MySQL version 5.6** or greater. ( You can communicate with your hosting provider to get it updated. )
* Nginx or Apache with mod_rewrite module.
* Make sure your hosting is based on SSD drives.
* It is recommended that you should use a VPS instead of shared hosting as it gives you better resources to work on.
* Use a good cache plugin like **[WP Fastest Cache Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-fastest-cache/)** and test your site properly after installing and configuring it.
* Images should also be compressed using a plugin like **[Imagify](https://wordpress.org/plugins/imagify/)** for good performance.
* We also recommend you to use **BunnyCDN** (using their WordPress Plugin which is **[BunnyCDN â€“ WordPress CDN Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/bunnycdn/)**) as we have tested it and it turn out to be one of the finest plugins for CDN.

### **RealHomes Specific**

* Do not unify (combine) JavaScript files for RealHomes theme while using a cache plugin ( or any optimisation plugin ) as it is not an average blog theme and certain scripts are only loaded when required. Also, dynamic data is generated before few scripts based on various settings. So, Combining JavaScript files can create errors.
* RealHomes uses following cookies (if related settings are enabled). So, You can configure your cache plugin to not cache pages that uses these cookies OR you can request the same from your host if your host is like WPEngine ( who do not allow cache plugin and handles the cache on server level ).
