## Tips to Improve Website Performance

Here are some recommended practices to optimize your website's performance:

- **Hosting:** Opt for an SSD-based VPS over shared hosting for better resources.
- **PHP & MySQL:** Ensure you're running **PHP 7.4 or newer** and **MySQL 5.6 or higher**. Contact your hosting provider for updates.
- **Caching:** Use a reliable cache plugin like [WP Fastest Cache](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-fastest-cache/). Test your site thoroughly after configuration.
- **Speed Optimization:** Enhance loading times with plugins like [Flying Pages](https://wordpress.org/plugins/flying-pages/).
- **Image Optimization:** Compress images with a plugin like [Imagify](https://wordpress.org/plugins/imagify/).
- **CDN:** Use a CDN service to deliver content faster and more efficiently.

## RealHomes Specific Cache Configurations

When configuring cache for RealHomes, keep these points in mind:

- **JavaScript Files:** Do not combine JavaScript files; RealHomes loads scripts dynamically based on various settings, which can lead to errors if combined.
- **Cookies:** RealHomes uses cookies like `realhomes_current_currency`. Ensure your cache plugin excludes pages using these cookies, or ask your hosting provider to handle this if using managed hosting like WPEngine.

## Using a Child Theme

To ensure smooth updates of the parent theme, we strongly recommend using a child theme. The main theme package (`rh-main-package.zip`) downloaded from [ThemeForest](https://themeforest.net/downloads) includes a ready-to-use child theme (`realhomes-child.zip`).
