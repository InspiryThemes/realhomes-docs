## Tips to Improve Website Performance

* Opt for a VPS over shared hosting and ensure it's SSD-based for better resources.
* Upgrade to **PHP 7.4 or newer**, a requirement for WordPress, and ensure MySQL version is **5.6 or higher** (Contact your hosting provider for updates).
* Use a reliable cache plugin like **[WP Fastest Cache Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-fastest-cache/)** and thoroughly test your site after installation and configuration.
* Enhance user experience with plugins like **[Flying Pages](https://wordpress.org/plugins/flying-pages/)** for faster loading.
* Reduce image load times with an image compression plugin such as **[Imagify](https://wordpress.org/plugins/imagify/)**.
* Boost performance by leveraging a CDN service to deliver content faster and more efficiently.

## RealHomes Specific Cache Configurations

* Do not unify (combine) JavaScript files for RealHomes theme while using a cache plugin ( or any optimisation plugin ) as it is not an average blog theme and certain scripts are only loaded when required. Also, dynamic data is generated before few scripts based on various settings. So, Combining JavaScript files can create errors.
* RealHomes uses following cookies (if related setting/plugin is enabled). So, You can configure your cache plugin to not cache pages that uses these cookies OR you can request the same from your host if your host is like WPEngine ( who do not allow cache plugin and handles the cache on server level ).

## About Child Theme

It is highly recommended to use the child theme to facilitate seamless updates of the parent theme whenever new versions are released. The main theme pack downloaded from <a target="_blank" href="https://themeforest.net/downloads">ThemeForest</a> includes a pre-built, ready-to-use child theme, often referred to as "**rh-main-package.zip**".

## How to Update Theme
RealHomes provides auto-updates within WordPress dashboard.
