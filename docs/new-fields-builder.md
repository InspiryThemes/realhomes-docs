### **New Fields Builder Guide**
- You can re-order a field by drag and drop handle that you can be seen near the field label.
- For multi-option fields e.g ***Checkbox***, ***Radio*** and ***Select*** you can add comma separated values to create lists.
- Don't forget to ***Save Settings*** once you are done with adding new fields.

!!! warning "Important"

    The New Field Builder is added in {==**v3.10.0**==} so if you have RealHomes Theme older than 3.10.0 then you must update it to the latest version to have it.
