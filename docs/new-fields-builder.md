### New Fields Builder Guide
- You can reorder a field by drag and drop handle that you can see near the field label.
- For the multi-option fields e.g *Checkbox*, *Radio* and *Select* you can add comma separated values to create lists.
- **Important:** Don't forget to *Save Settings* once you are done with adding new fields.
